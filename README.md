### 🤖 Using Claude to Extract Paper Information

To quickly add papers using AI assistance, use this prompt with Claude:

**Copy this prompt:**
```
I'm using a Research Paper Tracker app and need you to extract paper information. Please analyze this paper [URL/title/content] and return the information in this exact JSON format:

{
  "title": "Full paper title",
  "authors": "Author names in APA format (Last, F. M., Last, F. M., & Last, F. M.)",
  "year": "Publication year",
  "journal": "Journal or venue name",
  "keywords": "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, keyword4",
  "abstract": "Key findings, methodology, and main contributions in 2-3 sentences",
  "url": "DOI link or paper URL",
  "relevance": "Why this paper might be relevant to research (1-2 sentences)"
}

Please ensure the JSON is properly formatted so I can copy-paste it directly into my tracker.
```

**Example usage:**
- For URLs: `"Please analyze this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 and return..."`
- For titles: `"Please analyze the paper 'Attention Is All You Need' by Vaswani et al..."`
- For multiple papers: `"Please extract information from these papers: [list] and return each in the JSON format..."`

**Pro tips for better results:**
- ✅ Mention your research area: "I'm studying machine learning"
